<p>With Kineo, you can create stunning hand-drawn animations on your iPhone or iPad. Kineo’s flipbook-style drawing tools make it easy for you to create and share your animations with the world.</p>
<p>Kineo shows you faint reminders of the last few pages, making it easy to draw the next. When you’re done, you can share your creation on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and more; you can even use your very own animations as stickers in the Messages app!</p>
<p>While Kineo makes it easy to create basic animations, it definitely doesn’t stop there. Kineo’s great support for the Apple Pencil lets your creativity flow. Use multi-window mode on iPad to preview your animation as you draw it. Need to take your work on the go? Kineo syncs automatically over iCloud so you can take your animations with you, no matter what device you’ve got on hand.</p>
<h3>Coming Soon.</h3>
<p>Kineo is currently in beta. If you’d like to help test Kineo or try it out prior to release, you can sign up for the beta <a href="/beta">here</a>.</p>
