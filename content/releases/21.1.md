Sharing your animations just got a big overhaul! Animations aren't tied to an ugly pointy square any more—you can now share them with the canvas you see in Kineo.

Kineo now also supports different video shapes. In addition to the existing square, there's now support for both horizontal and vertical videos, so your videos will look their best, no matter where you share them.

We've also made it easier to switch between looping and bouncing animations—switching between these is now just the tap of a button.
