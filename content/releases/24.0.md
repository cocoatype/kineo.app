With Kineo, you can create stunning hand-drawn animations on Vision Pro. Kineo’s flipbook-style drawing tools make it easy for you to create and share your animations with the world. On Vision Pro, you can even arrange your drawings in front and behind each other in 3D space.

Kineo shows you faint reminders of the last few pages, making it easy to draw the next. When you’re done, you can share your creation on your favorite social networks; you can even save them as Spatial Video!

**Note:** This version never actually shipped to users. Version 24.1 was the first public version of Kineo for Vision Pro.
