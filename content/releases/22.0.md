This update gives you more power over your animation canvas! You can now select a different color for your animation background, such as a bright blue sky, yellow "sticky note", or black for a cool dark mode! Stickers in iMessage now include the canvas, so you can show off the colors you've chosen.

Kineo also now includes a quick guide for first-time users, to get you started drawing and animating quickly.

This release also fixes a few bugs:
- Scrolling the page strip should always have hidden the "previous pages" images. It now does so.
- In some circumstances, you could accidentally trigger the "welcome to Kineo" page multiple times. Now it will only ever appear once.
