Kineo 22.3 fixes a few bugs with the gallery view, which shows all your animations:

- When long-pressing an animation, the preview had no background color or image, causing your animation to play over the rest of the gallery instead.
- When long-pressing an animation, there was a "Share" menu item that had no effect. This menu item now works.
