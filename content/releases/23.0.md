Kineo 23.0 fixes a few obnoxious bugs:

- A crash would occur if you long-pressed the + button for adding a new page.
- It was impossible to export an animation on the first-ever launch of the app, after seeing or skipping the app tutorial.

New features are underway and should be appearing soon! Thank you for your patience.
