Another small update this time.

- Even more undo fixes. I really think it works this time?
- Better preview when sharing animations.
- The thumbnails in the gallery now have more accurate colors. Make any change to an existing animation to "fix" the thumbnail.
- Fixed the current version number in settings; it now shows the correct version number instead of "20.0".
