Introducing Kineo Proâ€”powerful extra features for Kineo! Kineo Pro currently includes the following features:

- Zoom in on your animation! Zooming in allows you to have more control over fine details. The drawing tools stay at the same size when zooming in, letting you draw much smaller lines than previously possible. (Only on iPad.)

- Remove the "kineo.app" watermark that appears on shared videos. Want to focus your videos on the work you've created? Hide the Kineo advertisement that previously appeared on all exports.

Many more Pro features are planned very soon, and they'll all be included in this one-time purchase!

This version also includes bug fixes for all users. This includes a common crash which would happen if you used the eraser and then immediately changed pages. Erasing should now be a much less treacherous act. :)
