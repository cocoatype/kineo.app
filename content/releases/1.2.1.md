The release notes for this version are lost to history. As are the release notes (and, for that matter, the release date) for versions 1.2, 1.1.1, 1.1, 1.0.5, 1.0.3, 1.0.2, and 1.0.1. The App Store literally didn't track release dates before that. I don't know where I'd even go to look up that kind of information. Sorry. :(

And yes, that list of release versions is correct. No, I don't know why there isn't a 1.0.4. I blame App Review Gremlins.
