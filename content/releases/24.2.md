This version improves a lot of little annoyances on Vision Pro:

- Previous frame reminders ("onion skins") now appear behind content instead of hiding your newest drawings.
- Playing an animation happens in the same area as drawing, rather than jumping in front of the tool bar.
- Hid the toggle for the Kineo Pro "hide watermark" feature, as Kineo Pro is not yet available on Vision Pro.
- The help button is now properly titled "Help" instead of "RootView.settingsButton".
