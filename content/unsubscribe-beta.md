# Kineo Beta
## Leaving so soon?
We&apos;re sorry to see you unsubscribe from Kineo beta e-mails, but it&apos;s totally understandable.

Note that unsubscribing from these e-mails will <strong>not</strong> unsubscribe you from the TestFlight beta, and you may continue to receive automated e-mails from Apple due to that. If you&apos;d like to unsubscribe from the TestFlight beta as well, you can do so in the TestFlight app.

<form action="https://mail.kineo.app/unsubscribe" method="POST">
    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
    <input type="email" id="unsubscribe-address" name="address" placeholder="hello@cocoatype.com"/>
</form>
<p>If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:hello@cocoatype.com">hello@cocoatype.com</a>.</p>
{{< script "const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);const address = urlParams.get('address');if (address != null) { document.getElementById('unsubscribe-address').setAttribute('value', address); }" >}}
