# Press Kit
## All you need to know about Kineo.

### Under Construction.
A lot of resources on this page are missing. That's because Kineo is still in development, and things such as app layout may change before release. As such, most graphical content isn't created or uploaded yet.

If you're interested in covering Kineo's release, the best way to be notified when this changes is to [join the beta](/beta). Members of the TestFlight beta will get email updates about the progress of the app, and I'll post there when I fill out this press page.

### We Go Way Back.
Kineo is older than it looks. The first version of Kineo was released on August 4th, 2008 &mdash; less than a month after the App Store first opened! It was originally discontinued in 2010, but after the release of iOS 13 and its PencilKit framework, I've decided to bring it back. The new version of Kineo supports all the modern niceties expected of an iOS app today: iPad support, iCloud sync, sharing to all your favorite social networks, and more.

I've also uploaded the [original Kineo website](/legacy) if you want a taste of what app development looked like more than a decade ago.
