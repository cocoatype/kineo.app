Here's another small bug-fix release, focused again on fixing undo issues! I'm hoping I've really fixed it this time, so I can focus on more-impactful features for once.

I've also improved the preview that you get when sharing animations. Rather than a text insertion point (which is pretty odd for a video), you'll now see a thumbnail of your animation.

Speaking of thumbnails, I fixed a minor coloring issue they had. Now the thumbnail should look more like your actual animation!

Finally, I fixed the version number that appears on the settings screen so that it‚Ä¶ actually shows the correct version number. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fortunately, the most common way people reach out for support is using the built-in e-mail option, which includes the correct version number, so this wasn't as big of an issue as it could be.
