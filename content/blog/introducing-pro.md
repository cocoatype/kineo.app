Kineo 22.1 was released today, with a new set of features under the title "Kineo Pro". Kineo Pro is a one-time in-app purchase that unlocks new powerful features.

Kineo Pro is launching with two initial features:

### Watermark Removal

When exporting a video of an animation from Kineo, it includes a watermark promoting Kineo with a link to [kineo.app](https://kineo.app). For artists with Kineo Pro, this watermark is off by default, meaning shared videos can now focus more completely on the animation they created.

### Zooming

Being able to zoom in on the canvas has been the #1 most-requested feature for Kineo since the day it relaunched. It might even be the most-requested feature since the original launch back in 2008. Kineo Pro now allows this feature to exist. For more information on what that means, see [Zooming in on Zooming](/blog/zooming).

Zooming allows artists to make much more fine-grained changes to their animations. When zooming in, artists can now draw on a much larger version of their animation, meaning that each mark they make can now be more precise and add more detail to the image overall.

### Coming Soon

This may be a small feature set at launch, but many more features are on the [roadmap](https://git.pado.name/groups/kineo/-/milestones), and I'm hoping to ship them quickly, now that the base for Kineo Pro is out. All of these upcoming Kineo Pro features will be included for all existing purchasers of Kineo Pro; no extra purchase necessary. Kineo Pro is not a subscription; purchasing Kineo Pro will unlock all features for the lifetime of the app.
